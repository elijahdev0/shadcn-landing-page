Okay, excellent! I'm glad the CSV import is working.

Here's a summary of what we've accomplished and the plan for the remaining features, which you can use to provide context in a new chat session:

**Overall Project Goal:**

We are building an Event Management SaaS application. The goal is to allow users to create and manage events, invite guests, track RSVPs, and manage contact lists.

**Key Features Implemented So Far:**

1.  **User Authentication & Core Structure:**
    *   User login functionality.
    *   Protected routes for authenticated users.
    *   Basic application structure with a Navbar, Footer, and routing (`App.tsx`).
    *   Core pages: `HomePage.tsx`, `LoginPage.tsx`, `NotFoundPage.tsx`.

2.  **Event Creation & Management:**
    *   **`CreateEventPage.tsx`:** Users can create new events with details like name, description, date, location, and public/private status. Data is saved to the `events` table in Supabase.
    *   **Redirect after Creation:** Upon successful event creation, the user is redirected to the newly created event's detail page.
    *   **`DashboardPage.tsx`:** Displays a list of events created by the logged-in user. Events are fetched from the `events` table.

3.  **Event Details & RSVP Functionality:**
    *   **`EventDetailPage.tsx`:**
        *   Displays detailed information about a specific event, fetched from the `events` table.
        *   Includes a "Copy RSVP Link" button that copies the link to the dedicated RSVP page for that event.
        *   **Displays a list of RSVPs** for the event (Name, Email, Status, Submitted At) in a table. This data is fetched from the `rsvps` table. (RLS policies for this are currently permissive and will be tightened later).
    *   **`RsvpPage.tsx`:**
        *   A dedicated, public page (e.g., `/rsvp/:eventId`) where guests can RSVP anonymously.
        *   Displays minimal event details (name, date) for context.
        *   Guests submit their Name, Email, and Attending/Not Attending status.
        *   RSVP data is saved to the `rsvps` table in Supabase.
    *   **Database Tables:**
        *   `events`: Stores event information.
        *   `rsvps`: Stores RSVP submissions, linked to events.

4.  **Guest List Management (Phase 1 Implemented):**
    *   **`GuestListPage.tsx`:**
        *   A new page accessible via a protected route (`/guest-lists`).
        *   Allows users to **import contacts via CSV file upload**. The CSV is expected to have "Name", "Email", and "Phone" headers.
        *   Displays the logged-in user's imported contacts in a table (Name, Email, Phone, Source, Added On).
    *   **Database Table:**
        *   `contacts`: Stores contact information (`id`, `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `source`, `created_at`, `updated_at`). RLS policies ensure users can only manage their own contacts.
    *   **Dependencies:** `papaparse` (and `@types/papaparse`) installed and used for CSV parsing.

**File Summary (Key Files Created/Modified for Recent Features):**

*   **Database Tables Created/Managed:**
    *   `events`
    *   `rsvps` (with basic RLS for public insert and (currently) public read)
    *   `contacts` (with RLS for user-specific CRUD operations)
*   **Frontend Pages (`src/pages/`):**
    *   `CreateEventPage.tsx`
    *   `DashboardPage.tsx`
    *   `EventDetailPage.tsx`
    *   `RsvpPage.tsx`
    *   `GuestListPage.tsx`
*   **Routing (`src/App.tsx`):** Updated to include routes for all the above pages, with appropriate `ProtectedRoute` usage.
*   **UI Components (`src/components/ui/`):** Standard Shadcn UI components are used throughout (Button, Card, Table, Input, Skeleton, Toast, etc.). `radio-group` was added.

**Remaining Phases for Guest List Management & Integration:**

*   **Phase 2: Enhanced Contact Management on `GuestListPage.tsx`**
    *   Implement vCard import functionality.
    *   Allow manual entry of new contacts.
    *   Implement functionality to edit existing contacts.
    *   Implement functionality to delete contacts.

*   **Phase 3: Contact Grouping on `GuestListPage.tsx`**
    *   **Database:** Create a `contact_groups` table (`id`, `user_id`, `name`) and a `contact_group_members` join table (`contact_id`, `group_id`).
    *   **UI:** Allow users to create, rename, and delete contact groups (e.g., "Family," "Work Colleagues").
    *   **UI:** Allow users to assign contacts to one or more groups and remove them from groups.

*   **Phase 4: Creating "Event Guest Lists"**
    *   **Database:** Create an `event_guest_lists` table (`id`, `user_id`, `event_id`, `name` - e.g., "VIPs for Summer Fest", "Family for Birthday").
    *   **Database:** Create an `event_guest_list_contacts` table (`guest_list_id`, `contact_id`, `status` - e.g., 'Invited', 'Attended', 'Declined (manual)').
    *   **UI (Potentially on `GuestListPage.tsx` or a new dedicated section/page):**
        *   Allow users to create a named guest list for a *specific event*.
        *   When creating/editing this event-specific guest list, users can add contacts by:
            *   Selecting individual contacts from their main contact list.
            *   Selecting entire contact groups.

*   **Phase 5: Integrating Guest Lists with Events on `EventDetailPage.tsx`**
    *   **UI:** On the `EventDetailPage.tsx` (for the event creator), add a section to:
        *   View and manage the event-specific guest list(s) associated with *this* event.
        *   Option to "attach" or "select" an existing `event_guest_list` (created in Phase 4) to the current event, or create a new one for it.

*   **Phase 6: Enhancing RSVP Display on `EventDetailPage.tsx`**
    *   When displaying the list of people who have RSVP'd (from the `rsvps` table), cross-reference this with the `event_guest_list_contacts` for that event.
    *   **UI:** Add a column or indicator to the RSVP list (e.g., a badge or icon) to show if the person who RSVP'd was on the original "invited" guest list for that event.
    *   Potentially show a summary: "X RSVPs received (Y from guest list, Z organic)."

*   **Security Refinement (Ongoing):**
    *   Review and tighten RLS policies for all tables, especially `rsvps` and `events` (e.g., ensuring only event creators can see detailed RSVP lists, and access to private events is restricted).

This detailed context should provide a solid foundation for continuing the development in a new chat session.
